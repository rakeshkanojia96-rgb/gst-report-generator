    <h5>1. Overview</h5>
    <p>
      GST Report Generator is a digital software service that helps you generate
      GSTR‑1 JSON files (GST portal offline tool compatible) and Excel reports from your
      marketplace data (Amazon, Meesho).
    </p>

    <h5>2. Free Trial</h5>
    <p>
      We provide a 15‑day free trial so you can evaluate the Service before purchasing a subscription.
      During the trial you can use the core features without payment.
    </p>

    <h5>3. Subscriptions</h5>
    <p>
      Subscriptions are billed yearly. Your subscription becomes active immediately after successful payment.
    </p>

    <h5>4. Cancellation</h5>
    <p>
      You may cancel your upcoming renewal at any time by contacting support. Your current subscription will remain
      active until the end of the paid period.
    </p>

    <h5>5. Refunds</h5>
    <p>
      Due to the nature of a digital software service, payments that have already been captured are generally
      non‑refundable. However, if you are facing a technical issue that prevents you from using the Service as
      advertised, please contact us within 7 days of purchase. We will review your case and may provide a
      partial or full refund at our discretion.
    </p>

    <h5>6. How to Contact</h5>
    <p>
      For cancellations or refund requests, email us at
      <a href="mailto:rakeshkanojia96@gmail.com">rakeshkanojia96@gmail.com</a> from your registered email ID.
